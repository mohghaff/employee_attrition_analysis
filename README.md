Employee Attrition Analytics Dashboard Documentation


Overview
This documentation provides a detailed guide on the Employee Attrition Analytics dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard aims to visualize the attrition rate of employees based on three key factors: gender, education level, and age group. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures have been utilized to calculate and present the attrition rate accurately.

Dashboard Components
The Employee Attrition Analytics dashboard comprises several key components:

1. Attrition Rate by Gender
This visual represents the attrition rate categorized by gender. It offers insights into how attrition varies between male and female employees. The attrition rate is calculated as the number of employees who left the company divided by the total number of employees.

2. Attrition Rate by Education Level
This visual displays the attrition rate based on the education level of employees. It allows us to understand whether attrition varies among employees with different educational backgrounds. The attrition rate is computed using the same formula as in the gender category.

3. Attrition Rate by Age Group
The attrition rate by age group visualizes the differences in attrition across various age brackets. Age groups are defined to provide a clear understanding of attrition patterns among younger and older employees. The attrition rate is again calculated in a similar manner as in the previous categories.

4. DAX Measures
Several DAX measures have been created to facilitate the calculations for the dashboard. These measures include:

Total Employees: Calculates the total number of employees in the dataset.

Attrition Count: Computes the total number of employees who left the company.

Attrition Rate (%): Utilizes the Attrition Count and Total Employees measures to calculate the attrition rate as a percentage.

Interactivity
Slicers: Slicers have been added to the dashboard to allow users to filter and select  education levels. This enables dynamic exploration of attrition rates for different subcategories.



Conclusion
The Employee Attrition Analytics dashboard in Power BI serves as a powerful tool to analyze and visualize attrition rates based on gender, education level, and age group. The DAX measures ensure accurate and dynamic calculations, allowing users to gain valuable insights into employee attrition patterns. This dashboard can be a valuable resource for HR professionals and decision-makers in understanding and addressing attrition within the organization.
